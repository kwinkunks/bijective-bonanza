# bijective-bonanza

This script builds a quiz. It was a one-off and is pretty hacky.

As it stands, it was for a group of developers; it reads data from [this Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2qJaO8kpTyOc49NXZJ1G3L3KXABWvfPQ6Brh5cxsYA/edit?usp=sharing) but you can just copy the format and point it at different data.

Not sure what else to call the format of this quiz — the basic idea is that you have to map the things on the left to the things on the right. So all the answers are in front of you, what could be simpler? :)
